RabbitMQ Notes:
	-> Following are terms in RabbitMQ:
			1. Producer -> one who gonna create/produce messages.
			2. Exchange -> one which gonna process the producer messages.
			3. Queue -> place where exchange will be pushing producer messages.
			4. Consumer -> one who gonna consume/use messages.
			5. Connection -> to push messages the producer will open a connection.
			6. Channel -> the message will be pushed via channel, and one connection can have multiple channels.

	-> Exchange connnects with Queues via BindingKey.
	-> Publisher have the RoutingKey for sending messages to specific queue where PublisherRoutingKey == QueueBindingKey.

	-> Types of Exchanges:
			0. Default/Nameless:
				It uses PublisherRoutingKey == QueueName, instead of PublisherRoutingKey == QueueBindingKey.
			1. Fanout:
				It ignores the RoutingKey, and BindingKey and send messages to all Queues.
			2. Direct:
				It sends message(s) to only Queue(s) where PublisherRoutingKey == Queue(s)BindingKey.
			3. Topic:
				It uses partial key matching via wildcards, sterik(*) matches one word and hash(#) matches 0 or more words. '*' example: Lets say 'abc.*' is a routing key &
				queue having binding key 'abc.xyz' then it matches, but if binding key is 'abc.def.xyz' then it'll not match. '#' example: Lets say 'abc.#' is a routing key
				and queue having binding key e.g. 'abc.', 'abc.xyz', 'abc.def.xyz', 'abc.000.111.222.333.444.555.666.777.888.999' then it'll match with all of them.

			4. Header:
				It uses message header instead of RoutingKey.
