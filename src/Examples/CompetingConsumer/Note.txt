1. To understand CompetingConsumer concept properly first start producer with single consumer and see the messages in console. 
   You'll find that one consumer is unable to process all messages from producer and messages are stacking up in queue many issues e.g. reliability, efficiency, etc.
2. The up another consumer with previous setup and it'll balance the things allowing scalability, reliability and efficiency in place.
